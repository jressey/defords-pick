## I'm not sure what this is going to be. Right now I just want to see what is the most compelling game on tv based on some rules I introduce.

To get started, get api keys for each feed you want at: [sportradar](https://developer.sportradar.com/)

You'll need the following:
- NHL v6 (I think the version number is excluded from some of their docs)
- NFL v5

Create a `.env` file and copy the contents of `sample.env`. Fill in the API keys you got from sportradar.
